<div>FizzBuzz is a coding problem often given to programming job candidates. A surprising percentage of programmers have difficulty solving this coding challenge, or take longer than expected to devise a solution, or come up with a needlessly complex solution.<br /><br />

Challenge - Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".<br /><br />
  
For example: 1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz 16 17 Fizz 19 Buzz and so on...
