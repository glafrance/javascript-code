# javascript-code
JavaScript examples, tutorials, and problems.

Initially this repository is for me to solidify and extend my knowledge of raw JavaScript, so don't be surprised when you see seemingly archaic calls to document.getElementById(), and raw ajax calls. I'm also hoping these code examples, tutorials and challenges will help others develop their web development expertise.

When this site is more complete, and when my AngujarJS skills are a bit more solid, I plan to replicate this site in Angular, and then perhaps in React and Backbone as well.
