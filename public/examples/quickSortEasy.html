<div>Quick sort is a "divide and conquer" algorithm, similar to the merge sort, because it recursively divides an array and operates on the two halves. The array is not really divided, but several indexes allow the algorithm to operate on separate "partitions" of the array.<br /><br />
  
Quick sort selects a pivot value within the array, and (virtually) divides the array into two partial arrays, where all values in one of the partial arrays are less than the pivot value, and all values in the other partial array are greater than the pivot value. Then a quick sort is recursively performed on each of the two partial arrays.<br /><br />
    
It seems harder to visualize the quick sort, compared to the <a class="obviousLink" href="#" onclick="showPage('mergeSortEasy.html', 'mergeSortEasySolution.html');return false;">merge sort</a>, which I find easier to visualize. If you are familiar with the quick sort concept you can start the challenge right away, otherwise you can continue below to help you understand how the quick sort works, where I give you the solution and we go through the code together.<br /><br />  
  
Consider performing a quick sort on this array: [ 5, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 0, 1, 6, 7 ]<br /><br />

Challenge - create one or more functions that together perform a quick sort. You probably need three functions. You can see the solution by clicking the link at the <a class="obviousLink" href="#bottom">bottom of the page</a>.<br /><br />
  
So if you tried the challenge and had some issues, or if you have no idea where to begin, let's go through the solution. Three functions are required for this solution. The first function simply takes the array to be sorted, and calls the second function, passing the array, 0 and the length of the array minus 1:<br /><br />
  
<pre>
// general function to perform a quick sort

function quickSort (arr) {
  doQuickSort(arr, 0, arr.length - 1);
}
</pre><br />  
  
The second function takes an array, a starting index, and an ending index. This function calls the third function (it has the meat of the quick sort algorithm) to get the pivot index, and then this second function recursively calls itself on the two (virtual) partial arrays (divided by the pivot index):<br /><br />
  
<pre>
// function to get a pivot index and execute 
// two recursive calls on partial arrays

function doQuickSort (inputArray, first, last) {
  if (last > first) {
    var pivotIndex = partitionArray(inputArray, first, last);
    doQuickSort (inputArray, first, pivotIndex - 1);
    doQuickSort (inputArray, pivotIndex + 1, last);
  }
}
</pre><br />  

The third function is partitionArray(). This function is where the difficult meat of the quick sort happens. Here's the input array as a reminder:<br /><br />  
  
[ 5, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 0, 1, 6, 7 ]<br /><br />
  
<pre>
function partitionArray(array, first, last) {
  var pivotValue = array[first];
  var lowIndex = first + 1; // used during a forward search
  var highIndex = last; // used during a backward search

  while (highIndex > lowIndex) {
    // perform the forward search
    while (lowIndex <= highIndex && array[lowIndex] <= pivotValue) {
      lowIndex++;
    }

    // perform the backward search
    while (lowIndex <= highIndex && array[highIndex] > pivotValue) {
      highIndex--;
    }

    // swap two elements in the array if necessary
    if (highIndex > lowIndex) {
      var temp = array[highIndex];
      array[highIndex] = array[lowIndex];
      array[lowIndex] = temp;
    }          
  }

  // adjust highIndex to know if need to swap the 
  // pivot value with array[highIndex] if necessary
  while (highIndex > first && array[highIndex] >= pivotValue) {
    highIndex--;
  }

  // swap the pivot value with array[highIndex] if necessary
  if (pivotValue > array[highIndex]) {
    array[first] = array[highIndex];
    array[highIndex] = pivotValue;
    return highIndex;
  } else {
    return first;
  }
}
</pre><br />

The function starts out setting a few variables:<br /><br />

<pre>
var pivotValue = array[first];
var lowIndex = first + 1; // used during a forward search
var highIndex = last; // used during a backward search
</pre><br />

pivotValue is set to the "first" item in the array. But remember that partitionArray() will be called repeatedly as doQuickSort() is called recursively on gradually smaller "virtual" partitions of the original array. So pivotValue is set to the first item of the current partition partitionArray() is operating on.<br /><br />

lowIndex is set to the index of the array item after pivotValue, and highIndex is set to the index of the last array item. Let's confirm where these variables are pointing to in the input array<br /><br />

<pre>
pivotValue (5 - an array value)
lowIndex   (1 - an array index)
highIndex  (9 - an array index)

  *  *                       *
[ 5, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 0, 1, 6, 7 ]
</pre><br />

partitionArray() accomplishes these important tasks:<br /><br />
  
- find where the in the array pivotValue should be placed<br />
- move other array items before of after that position<br /> 
- return the array index where the pivotValue was placed<br /><br />

The next block of code has a lot going on, so let's take it step-by-step.<br /><br />

<pre>
while (highIndex > lowIndex) {
  // perform the forward search
  while (lowIndex <= highIndex && array[lowIndex] <= pivotValue) {
    lowIndex++;
  }

  // perform the backward search
  while (lowIndex <= highIndex && array[highIndex] > pivotValue) {
    highIndex--;
  }

  // swap two elements in the array if necessary
  if (highIndex > lowIndex) {
    var temp = array[highIndex];
    array[highIndex] = array[lowIndex];
    array[lowIndex] = temp;
  }          
}
</pre><br />

The outer "while" loop simply ensures the code it contains continues until array elements whose values are less than or greater than the pivot value have been moved before or after the point where the pivot value will end up in the array when the outer "while" loop is exited.<br /><br />

The first inner "while" just moves the lowIndex pointer up until it finds an array item that is greater than the pivotValue.<br /><br />

<pre>
while (lowIndex <= highIndex && array[lowIndex] <= pivotValue) {
  lowIndex++;
}
</pre><br />

The second inner "while" just moves the highIndex pointer down until it finds an array item that is less than or equal to the pivotValue.<br /><br />

<pre>
while (lowIndex <= highIndex && array[highIndex] > pivotValue) {
  highIndex--;
}
</pre><br />

These inner while loops will also exit if lowIndex is greater than highIndex, but ignore that for now.<br /><br />

So the first time code execution gets just beyond these two inner while loops, lowIndex and highIndex are pointing at these array elements:<br /><br />

<pre>
    lowIndex      highIndex
        *              *
[ 5, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 0, 1, 6, 7 ]
</pre><br />

The two inner while loops are finished for this iteration of the outer while loop because 9 (array[lowIndex]) is greater than 5 (pivotValue) and because 1 (array[highIndex]) is less than than 5 (pivotValue).<br /><br />

Now the code following the inner while loops compares highIndex and lowIndex, and in this case swaps the 9 and the 1 to put them in the right locations relative to where the pivotValue of 5 will eventaully be.<br /><br /> 

<pre>
if (highIndex > lowIndex) {
  var temp = array[highIndex];
  array[highIndex] = array[lowIndex];
  array[lowIndex] = temp;
}  
</pre><br />

So the array now looks like this:<br /><br />

[ 5, 2, 1, 3, 8, 4, 0, 9, 6, 7 ]<br /><br />

I should point out that the positions of these values are swapped, but these are not necessarily their final positions in the final sorted array after all the recursion is done. On any particular execution of partitionArray(), array items are just moved relative to the pivot value. It is the sum effect of the recursive calls of partitionArray() that result in a fully sorted array.<br /><br />

So now the outer while loop starts its next iteration. The inner while loops execute again, incrementing lowIndex and decrementing highIndex until they point to the following array items:<br /><br />

<pre>
        lowIndex   highIndex
              *     *
[ 5, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 0, 1, 6, 7 ]
</pre><br />

The two inner while loops are finished for this iteration of the outer while loop because 8 (array[lowIndex]) is greater than 5 (pivotValue) and because 0 (array[highIndex]) is less than than 5 (pivotValue).<br /><br />

Again the code following the inner while loops compares highIndex and lowIndex, and swaps the 8 and the 0 to put them in the right locations relative to where the pivotValue of 5 will eventaully be.<br /><br /> 

So the array now looks like this:<br /><br />

[ 5, 2, 1, 3, 0, 4, 8, 9, 6, 7 ]<br /><br />

The outer while loop starts its next iteration, and this time the values of lowIndex and highIndex are more important.<br /><br />

At the start of this outer while loop iteration, lowIndex is 4 and highIndex is 6.<br /><br />

<pre>
while (lowIndex <= highIndex && array[lowIndex] <= pivotValue) {
  lowIndex++;
}

while (lowIndex <= highIndex && array[highIndex] > pivotValue) {
  highIndex--;
}
</pre><br />

After these two inner while loops are done, highIndex is 5 and lowIndex is 6, and no further swapping of array items was necessary.<br /><br />

<pre>
        highIndex    lowIndex
                 *  *
[ 5, 2, 1, 3, 0, 4, 8, 9, 6, 7 ]
</pre><br />

So the outer while loop is done with its job. The array items have been moved relative to where the pivotValue will end up. The rest of the partitionArray() function determines where the pivotValue should be placed in the array, and returns the index of that position.<br /><br />

<pre>
// adjust highIndex to know if need to swap the 
// pivot value with array[highIndex] if necessary
while (highIndex > first && array[highIndex] >= pivotValue) {
  highIndex--;
}

// swap the pivot value with array[highIndex] if necessary
if (pivotValue > array[highIndex]) {
  array[first] = array[highIndex];
  array[highIndex] = pivotValue;
  return highIndex;
} else {
  return first;
}
</pre><br />

The first piece of this code adjusts highIndex down as necessary to find the position where the pivotValue should be placed in the array. It does this by comparing the array item at highIndex with pivotValue:<br /><br />

<pre>
while (highIndex > first && array[highIndex] >= pivotValue) {
  highIndex--;
}
</pre><br />

Finally, the last piece of code in the partitionArray() function places the pivotValue in its proper place, if necessary.<br /><br />

<pre>
if (pivotValue > array[highIndex]) {
  array[first] = array[highIndex];
  array[highIndex] = pivotValue;
  return highIndex;
} else {
  return first;
}
</pre><br />

At the end of the outer while loop discussed earlier, lowIndex and highIndex had crossed, with highIndex pointing at the array item having a value of 4:<br /><br />

<pre>
             highIndex
                 * 
[ 5, 2, 1, 3, 0, 4, 8, 9, 6, 7 ]
</pre><br />

So now the code determines that pivotValue (5) does need to be swapped with the item at highIndex, and the array ends up like this:<br /><br />

[ 4, 2, 1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 9, 6, 7 ]<br /><br />

Here we can clearly see that although other array items have been moved before or after the position of pivotValue, they are not completely sorted. Subsequent recursive calls of doQuickSort() and thus partitionArray() will lead to ever smaller "virtual" array partitions being processed, with an end result being a fully sorted array!<br /><br />

I encourage you to copy and execute the solution code, and examine it in greater detail for a more full understanding.<br /><br />

As I mentioned, true brainiacs may be able to visualize quick sort more immediately, but mere mortals like me need something more. I hope this has helped.
