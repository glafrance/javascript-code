<div>Insertion sort algorithms progress through an array of items to be sorted, inserting elements into a sorted sub-list until the entire array is sorted.<br /><br />
  
This is better understood through an illustration. Consider this array of numbers:<br /><br />
  
[ 2, 9, 5, 4, 8, 1, 6 ]<br /><br />
  
The insertion sort makes use of a temporary variable and two loops, an outer loop that iterates over elements 1 thru length - 1 (9, 5, 4, 8, 1, 6), and an inner loop that repeatedly iterates over the elements in the sorted sub-list. The inner loop iterates in the opposite direction within the sub-list (from the end toward the beginning).The sorted sub-list initially contains only the first array element (2). Note that this "sorted sub-list" is virtual in a sense, because it is simply a part of the actual array being sorted, and is represented and defined by the index of its last element. The sub-list is not a separate array.<br /><br />
  
More concretely, the first pass of the outer loop assigns the element at index 1 (9) to a temporary variable. The first pass of the inner loop compares the temporary variable (9) to the only value of the sorted sub-list (2). Because 2 is not greater than the temporary variable, no action is taken, and 9 is now considered to be part of the sorted sub-list [ 2, 9 ].  <br /><br />
  
The second pass of the outer loop assigns the element at index 2 (5) to the temporary variable. This time the first pass of the inner loop compares the temporary variable (5) to the last value of the sorted sub-list (9). Because 9 IS greater than the temporary variable (5), the value 9 is placed where the temporary value was (index 2). The second pass of the inner loop compares the temporary variable (5) to the next value of the sorted sub-list (2). Because the 2 is NOT greater than the temporary variable (5), the temporary value is placed after the 2 (where the 9 used to be).<br /><br />
  
At this point this is the sorted sub-list:<br /><br />  
  
[ 2, 5, 9 ]<br /><br />  
  
and this is the entire array:<br /><br />
  
[ 2, 5, 9, 4, 8, 1, 6 ]<br /><br /> 
  
Remember that the sorted sub-list is not a separate array, it is just a conceptual sub-array within the original array. The previous execution phase simply swapped the positions of the 9 and the 5.<br /><br />
  
During the next execution phase, the temporary variable will be 4. The inner loop will see that 9 is greater than 4, and it will move 9 to where the 4 was (it is actually copied, not moved):<br /><br />   
  
[ 2, 5, 9, 9, 8, 1, 6 ]<br /><br /> 
  
Then the inner loop will see that 5 is greater than 4, and it will move 5 up one position:<br /><br />   
  
[ 2, 5, 5, 9, 8, 1, 6 ]<br /><br /> 
  
Then the inner loop will see that 2 is NOT greater than 4, so it will place the temporary variable 4 after 2:<br /><br />   
  
[ 2, 4, 5, 9, 8, 1, 6 ]<br /><br /> 
  
This process continues until the entire array has been processed.<br /><br />   

Challenge - create a function that takes an array as a parameter and performs an insertion sort to sort the following array of state names in alphabetical order:<br /><br />

["Utah", "Maine", "Virginia", "South Carolina", "Hawaii", "Michigan", "Kansas", "North Dakota", "Iowa", "Oregon", "Arkansas", "Connecticut", "Florida", "Rhode Island", "Nevada", "Montana", "West Virginia", "Georgia", "Alaska", "Tennessee", "California", "Idaho", "Kentucky", "Maryland", "Missouri", "New Mexico", "Ohio", "Wisconsin", "Illinois", "Mississippi", "Delaware", "New York", "North Carolina", "Colorado", "Wyoming", "Texas", "Washington", "New Hampshire", "Louisiana", "South Dakota", "Alabama", "Vermont", "Pennsylvania", "Arizona", "Massachusetts", "New Jersey", "Oklahoma", "Indiana", "Minnesota", "Nebraska"]
