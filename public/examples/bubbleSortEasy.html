<div>Bubble sort algorithms repeatedly step through a list of items to be sorted. Adjacent items are compared and swapped if they are in the wrong order. You repeat going through the list until no swaps are needed, indicating the list is sorted. Bubble sort is named for the way elements 'bubble' to the top of the list.<br /><br />

Challenge - create a function that takes an array as a parameter and performs a bubble sort to sort the following array of fruits in alphabetical order:<br /><br />

[ 'grape', 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'apricot', 'kiwi', 'strawberry']
